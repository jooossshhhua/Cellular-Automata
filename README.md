# Cellular-Automata

This project is a simple Python implementation of an Elementary Cellular Automaton, a one-dimensional system where each cell can be either alive (1) or dead (0), and its next state depends on itself and its two neighbors based on a rule number (0â€“255). The program starts with a single active cell in the middle and evolves the pattern over multiple generations.

Here are some famous rules:


# Rule 30
